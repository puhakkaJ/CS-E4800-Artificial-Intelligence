==================================

# Here it is critical that we have the assumption that siblings
# share both parents. (We could have a separate concept of
# half-sibling for the case when only one parent is shared.)
# Without that assumption this inference is not valid, because
# Jack and Anne would not have to share parents who are siblings.

# Jack --- sibling --- Mary                John --- sibling --- Anne
