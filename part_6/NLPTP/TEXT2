John sees Mary or Mary sleeps.
A man sees a woman and hears a man.
John's mother sleeps and snores.
A small man that snores and sleeps sees Mary.
Every man sleeps and snores and knows every woman.
A man sees a happy woman that sleeps.
A man sees a woman that sees a happy child that sleeps.
A sad man sees Mary.
